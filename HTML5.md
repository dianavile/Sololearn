## The List of Content Models
In HTML, elements typically belonged in the `block level` or `inline content` model. 
HTML5 introduces 7 main content models:

- 1) Metadata
- 2) Embedded
- 3) Interactive
- 4) Heading
- 5) Phrasing
- 6) Flow
- 7) Sectioning 

The HTML5 content models are designed to make the markup structure more meaningful for browser and web designer.

### Content Models

__Metadata:__ `Content that sets up presentation or behavior of rest of the content`. = in the head of the document.
_Elements:_`<base>, <link>, <meta>, <noscript>, <script>, <style>, <title>`

__Embedded:__ `Content that imports other resources into the document.`
_Elements:_ `<audio>, <video>, <canvas>, <iframe>, <img>, <math>, <object>, <svg>`

__Interactive:__ Content specifically intended for user interaction.
_Elements:_ `<a>, <audio>, <video>, <button>, <details>, <embed>, <iframe>, <img>, <input>, <label>, <object>, <select>, <textarea>`

__Heading:__= a section header.
_Elements:_ `<h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>, <hgroup>`

__Phrasing:__ `This model has a number of inline level elements in common with HTML4.`
_Elements:_ `<img>, <span>, <strong>, <label>, <br />, <small>, <sub>`

__NOTE:__ The same element can belong to more than one content model.

The various content models overlap in certain areas, 
depending on how they are being used:

__Flow content:__Contains the majority of HTML5 elements that would be included in the normal flow of the document.

__Sectioning content:__scope of headings, content, navigation, and footers.
Elements: `<article>, <aside>, <nav>, <section>`


### Page Structure in HTML5
A generic HTML5 page structure looks like this:

```
<header>
<nav>
<article>
<section> 
<footer>
```
__NOTE:__ You may not need some of these elements, depending on your page structure.

### The header Element
In HTML4, we would define a header like this:
`<div id="header">`

In HTML5, a `<header>` tag is used.
The <header> element is appropriate for use inside the body tag.
    
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
   <head></head>
   <body>
      <header>
        <h1> Most important heading </h1>
        <h3> Less important heading </h3>
      </header>
   </body>
</html>
```
__NOTE:__ Note that the `<header>` is completely different from the `<head>`tag.

### The footer element 
The `<footer>` Element = to refer the section located at the bottom of the web page.

`<footer>â€¦</footer>`

The footer contains the following information:

- Contact Information
- Privacy Policy
- Social Media Icons
- Terms of Service
- Copyright Information
- Sitemap and Related Documents

### The nav Element
The <nav> Element tag = a section with navigation links to other pages or within the page. 

``` 
<nav>
   <ul>
      <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">Services</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">About us</a></li>
   </ul>
</nav>
```
__NOTE:__ Not all of the links in a document should be inside a `<nav>` element. This element is intended only for major blocks of navigation links. 
The `<footer>` element often has a list of links that don't need to be in a` <nav>` element.
