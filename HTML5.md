## The List of Content Models
In HTML, elements typically belonged in the `block level` or `inline content` model. 
HTML5 introduces 7 main content models:

- 1) Metadata
- 2) Embedded
- 3) Interactive
- 4) Heading
- 5) Phrasing
- 6) Flow
- 7) Sectioning 

The HTML5 content models are designed to make the markup structure more meaningful for browser and web designer.

### Content Models

__Metadata:__ `Content that sets up presentation or behavior of rest of the content`. = in the head of the document.
_Elements:_`<base>, <link>, <meta>, <noscript>, <script>, <style>, <title>`

__Embedded:__ `Content that imports other resources into the document.`
_Elements:_ `<audio>, <video>, <canvas>, <iframe>, <img>, <math>, <object>, <svg>`

__Interactive:__ Content specifically intended for user interaction.
_Elements:_ `<a>, <audio>, <video>, <button>, <details>, <embed>, <iframe>, <img>, <input>, <label>, <object>, <select>, <textarea>`

__Heading:__= a section header.
_Elements:_ `<h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>, <hgroup>`

__Phrasing:__ `This model has a number of inline level elements in common with HTML4.`
_Elements:_ `<img>, <span>, <strong>, <label>, <br />, <small>, <sub>`

__NOTE:__ The same element can belong to more than one content model.

The various content models overlap in certain areas, 
depending on how they are being used:

__Flow content:__Contains the majority of HTML5 elements that would be included in the normal flow of the document.

__Sectioning content:__scope of headings, content, navigation, and footers.
Elements: `<article>, <aside>, <nav>, <section>`


### Page Structure in HTML5
A generic HTML5 page structure looks like this:

```
<header>
<nav>
<article>
<section> 
<footer>
```
__NOTE:__ You may not need some of these elements, depending on your page structure.

### The header Element
In HTML4, we would define a header like this:
`<div id="header">`

In HTML5, a `<header>` tag is used.
The <header> element is appropriate for use inside the body tag.
    
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
   <head></head>
   <body>
      <header>
        <h1> Most important heading </h1>
        <h3> Less important heading </h3>
      </header>
   </body>
</html>
```
__NOTE:__ Note that the `<header>` is completely different from the `<head>`tag.

### The footer element 
The `<footer>` Element = to refer the section located at the bottom of the web page.

`<footer>â€¦</footer>`

The footer contains the following information:
- Contact Information
- Privacy Policy
- Social Media Icons
- Terms of Service
- Copyright Information
- Sitemap and Related Documents

### The nav Element
The <nav> Element tag = a section with navigation links to other pages or within the page. 

``` 
<nav>
   <ul>
      <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">Services</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">About us</a></li>
   </ul>
</nav>
```
__NOTE:__ Not all of the links in a document should be inside a `<nav>` element. This element is intended only for major blocks of navigation links. 
The `<footer>` element often has a list of links that don't need to be in a` <nav>` element.

### Article, section & Aside
#### The article Element
The `<article>`-element = a self-contained piece of content to be used and distributed separately from the rest of the page or site. This could be a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, a blog entry, a comment, an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent piece of content. 

The `<article>` element replaces the `<div>` element that was widely used in HTML4, along with an `id` or `class`.
```
<article> 
   <h1>The article title</h1> 
   <p>Contents of the article element </p>
</article>
```
__NOTE:__ When an <article> element is nested, the inner element represents an article related to the outer element. 
For example, blog post comments can be <article> elements nested in the <article> representing the blog post.
    
#### The section Element 
A `<section>`- element = a logical container of _page_ or _article_. 
Sections can be used to divide up content within an article. 
Each <section> should be identified, by including a heading (h1-h6 element) as a child of <section>.
      
Example:
- a homepage with a section for introducing the company, news items, and contact information.
```
<article>
   <h1>Welcome</h1>
   <section>
      <h1>Heading</h1>
      <p>content or image</p>
   </section>
</article>    
```
__NOTE:__ If it makes sense to separately syndicate the content of a <section> element, use an <article> element instead.

#### The aside Element
The <aside> Element = secondary (tangential) content, separate from but indirectly related to the main content.
This is represented in sidebars.
When an <aside> tag is used within an <article> tag, the content of the <aside> should be specifically related to that article.
    
Example:
```    
<article>
   <h1> Gifts for everyone </h1>
   <p> This website will be the best place for choosing gifts </p>
   <aside>
      <p> Gifts will be delivered to you within 24 hours </p>
   </aside>
</article>
``` 
### The Audio element
__Audio on the Web__: Before HTML5, there was no standard for playing audio files on a web page.
The HTML5 ` <audio>`  element specifies a standard for embedding audio in a web page.

#### How to specify the audio source file's URL. 
METHOD 1: use __source attribute__:
``` 
<audio src="audio.mp3" controls>
   Audio element not supported by your browser
</audio>
```     

METHOD 2: use __<source> element inside <audio> element__:
``` 
<audio controls>
   <source src="audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
   <source src="audio.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
</audio>
 ``` 
Multiple <source> elements can be linked to different audio files. The browser will use the first recognized format.    

### Audio on the Web
The <audio> element creates an audio player inside the browser.
``` 
<audio controls>
   <source src="audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
   <source src="audio.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
   Audio element not supported by your browser. 
</audio>
 ``` 
__NOTE:__The text in between the audio tags `<audio>` and `</audio>` display in browsers that do not support the <audio> element.    

### Attributes of <audio>
- `controls`= audio controls should be displayed (such as a play/pause button, etc.)
- `autoplay`= audio starts playing as soon as it is ready, without asking for the visitor's permission.
``` 
<audio controls autoplay>
 ``` 

`loop` = to have the audio replay every time it is finished.
 ``` 
<audio controls autoplay loop>
```   
__NOTE:__ there are three supported file formats for the <audio> element: `MP3`, `WAV`, and `OGG`.

### Videos in HTML
The video element is similar to the audio element. 
You can specify the video source URL using an `attribute in a video element`, or using `source elements inside the video element`:
 ``` 
<video controls>
   <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
   <source src="video.ogg" type="video/ogg">
   Video is not supported by your browser
</video>
 ``` 
__NOTE:__ the major browsers do not all support the same file types. If the browser does not support the first video type, it will try the next one.

### Attributes of <video>
Another aspect shared by both the audio and the video elements is that each has controls, autoplay and loop attributes. 
- Example: the video will replay (after finishing playing)
 ``` 
<video controls autoplay loop>
   <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
   <source src="video.ogg" type="video/ogg">
   Video is not supported by your browser
</video>
 ```     
__NOTE:__ there are three supported video formats for the <video> element: `MP4`, `WebM`, and `OGG`.


### Progress Bar
The `<progress>` element = to create __progress bars__ on the web, within `headings`, `paragraphs`, or `elsewhere in the body`.

### Progress Element Attributes
__Value:__ how much of the task has been completed. 
__Max:__ how much work the task requires in total.

- Example:
 ``` 
Status: <progress min="0" max="100" value="35">
</progress>
 ``` 
__NOTE:__ Use the `<progress>` tag in conjunction with JavaScript to dynamically display a task's progress.

### HTML5 Web Storage
With `HTML5 web storage`, websites can store __data on a user's local computer.__ 
Before HTML5, we had to use JavaScript cookies to achieve this functionality. 

### Advantages of Web Storage:
- 1) More secure
- 2) Faster
- 3) Stores a larger amount of data
- 4) Stored data is not sent with every server request
- 5) Local storage is per domain. All pages from one domain can store and access the same data.

### Types of Web Storage Objects
There are two types of web storage objects:
- `sessionStorage()`
- `localStorage()`

### Local vs. Session
- __Session Storage__ = destroyed once the user closes the browser
- __Local Storage__ =  stores data with no expiration date
__NOTE:__  You need to be familiar with basic JavaScript in order to understand and use the API.
